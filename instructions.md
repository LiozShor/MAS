The goals of the final projet are for you to develop a deeper understanding of a specific research area related to the material covered in class and to experience technical writing!





Project proposal (presented in class):  by 3/1/26 23:59 (20% of project grade).  

Status update: 23/1 23.59 (10% of project grade)

Final report deadline:  15/2 (60% of project grade). 

Projects are done in pairs or in groups of three.



How to find good project ideas?



\*  Look at the team presentations!



\* we give some examples at this link (updated frequently after each class), as well as some systems you can download from the internet for supporting experiments. 



\* They are simply suggestions.  You may choose one of them or design your own project.   The descriptions are intentionally high-level as defining a problem and ways to address it are significant components of doing research.   



All written elements—the project proposal, status update and project report—should be in Overleaf and follow the Writing Style Guidelines.



Further details appear below.



Project proposal (2 pages):



The purpose of the project proposal is to make sure you have chosen an appropriate project. Your proposal should:



(a) Describe the general motivation for your project and the ways it relates to course topics.



(b) Present the (1-3) specific, concrete research questions that you will study and briefly discuss how you will address each one. Delegate which task is performed by which student. 



(c) List the related work that you have found and state briefly the relationship to your planned efforts.



(d) Ask for specific feedback: What is it that you're unsure about or need help with?



(e) include at least 2 references

Project status update 



Submit  a short (1 page) status update, describing: (a) what you’ve done so far; (b) what is left to do; (c) any problems or issues on which you would like our assistance.  



&nbsp;



Final report :

The written report should be 8-10 pages, following the paper formats and style guidelines in the Writing Style Guidelines handout. It should include the following elements, described in more detail in that document:



1\. Introduction: The problem you are addressing, motivation and summary of results and contributions.



2\. Related work (expanded version from the project proposal)



3\. Approach: This section will differ depending on the type of project you do. It might be the algorithm you designed, the agent you developed or the studies that you conducted.



4\. Evaluation: This section should describe any experiments you conducted and the results.



5\. Discussion:  Summarize insights from your work, its limitations and future directions.



6\. Appendices:  Team members individually submit descriptions of their contributions to the project (who did what).  Other uses of appendices are described in the Writing Guidelines.
